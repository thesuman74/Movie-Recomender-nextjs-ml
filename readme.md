# Features to Integrate

## Based on content , genre and collaborative filtering

### 1.User Profiling:

- User registration and login functionality
- User profilecreation, including mood information and movie preferences
- User rating and review system for movies

### 2.Recommendation Algorithms:

- Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based)
- Content-based filtering
- Hybrid approach combining multiple algorithms
- Matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### 3. Personalization:

- User behavior analysis, including search history and watch history
- Real-time recommendation updates based on user interactions

### 4. Search and Filtering:

- Advanced search functionality with filters for genre, director, cast, release date, and ratings
- Movie suggestions based on search queries and user preferences

### 5. Movie Information and Visualization:

- Detailed movie information, including plot summaries, trailers, and reviews
- Visualizations for movie ratings, genres, and other relevant data

### 6. Feedback Mechanism:

- User feedback system for rating and reviewing recommended movies
- Mechanism to incorporate user feedback into the recommendation algorithm

## Based on mood, facial expression and emotions

### 1. Face detection

### 2. Emotion Recognition

### 3. Emotion Mapping

    Create a mapping of emotions to movie genres or moods. For example:

- Happiness: Romantic Comedies, Animated Movies, or Uplifting Dramas
- Sadness: Tearjerkers, Dramas, or Melancholic Movies
- Anger: Action Movies, Thrillers, or Intense Dramas
- Fear: Horror Movies, Suspense Thrillers, or Paranormal Movies
- Surprise: Twisty Thrillers, Mysterious Movies, or Unpredictable Dramas

### 4. Mood-Based Recommendation

Different appraoches that can be used

- Emotion-Based Filtering: Use the detected emotion to filter the movie database and retrieve a list of movies that match the user's current mood.
- Weighted Recommendation: Assign weights to different emotions based on their intensity or relevance to the movie recommendation. For example, a strong happiness detection might result in a higher weight for Romantic Comedies.
- Hybrid Approach: Combine the mood-based recommendation with other factors, such as the user's viewing history, ratings, and preferences, to provide a more personalized recommendation.

this is what we will be using

#### Hybrid Approach

The Hybrid Approach involves combining the mood-based recommendation with other factors, such as:

- **User's viewing history:** Use the user's viewing history to identify their preferences and adjust the mood-based recommendation accordingly.
- **User's ratings:** Use the user's ratings to adjust the mood-based recommendation and prioritize movies with higher ratings.
- **User's preferences:** Use the user's preferences (e.g., favorite genres, actors, etc.) to adjust the mood-based recommendation and prioritize movies that match their preferences.

The hybrid approach can be implemented using various techniques, such as:

- **Weighted combination:** Combine the mood-based recommendation with other factors using weighted averages or sums.
- **Rank-based combination:** Combine the mood-based recommendation with other factors by ranking movies based on multiple criteria (e.g., mood, viewing history, ratings, etc.).
- **By combining multiple factors,** the hybrid approach can provide a more personalized and accurate movie recommendation that takes into account the user's current mood, preferences, and viewing history.
